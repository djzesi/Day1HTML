					Rohit Sharma- Never done that before (batting in
					Super Over). I didn't know what to expect, whether to go from the
					first ball or just take a single, try and put pressure on the last
					three or four balls of the over. I just wanted to stay still and
					was waiting for the bowler to make a mistake (on the last two
					sixes).
